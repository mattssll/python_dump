Chapter 02: Pythonic Code
=========================

Test the code::

   make test


Indexes are same as slice objects
lists, tuples, and strings are examples of sequences and iterators
Sequences implement the __getitem__ and the __len__ method
Iterators implement the __next__ and the __iter__ method
Context Managers implement the __enter__ and the __exit__ methods
List comprehensions, set comprehensions, and dictionary comprehensions
Expressions use the walrus operator (:=) to assign and return a value in the same expression
